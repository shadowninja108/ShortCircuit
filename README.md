# ShortCircuit

Web-based decoder for Splatoon 3 saves. Currently, decoding library is omitted (FirstStrike), so one must be provided if one wants to self-host.
Docker compose file is provided, just need to populate the `.env` file. I use `cloudflared` for providing external access to the application.

For more information, see the info modal within the application (`InfoModal.vue`).
